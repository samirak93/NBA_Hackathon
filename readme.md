This code was built for the NBA 2018 Business Analytics Hackathon.
##Problem

Business Analytics: We have provided a sample of 460 games (230 from the 2016-17 season and 230 from the 2017-18 season) 
for which your task is to predict total international viewers. To assist with your model, we have provided viewership numbers from 1,000 games 
by country in each of the two seasons, plus stats on team and player performance and status. Using these inputs, 
we would like you to predict the total number of international viewers for each of the 460 games in the test set.*


Any feedback or comments are appreciated.
